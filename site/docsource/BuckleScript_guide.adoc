BuckleScript is a backend for the {OCaml}[OCaml] compiler which emits
JavaScript. It works with both vanilla OCaml and {Reason}[Reason], the
whole compiler is compiled into JS (and ASM) so that you can play it
in the {BuckleScript-playground}[browser].

## Why BuckleScript

### The benefit of JavaScript platform

JavaScript is not just *the* browser language, it's also the *only*
existing cross platform language. It is truly everywhere: users don't
need to install binaries or use package managers to access software,
just a link will work.

Another important factor is that the JavaScript VM is quite fast and
keeps getting faster.  The JavaScript platform is therefore
increasingly capable of supporting large applications.

### Problems of JavaScript language and how BuckleScript solves it

BuckleScript is mainly designed to solve the problems of *large scale JavaScript programming*:

.  Lack of type-safety:
   {OCaml}[OCaml] offers an industrial-strength
   state-of-the-art type system and provides type inference (i.e. No
   verbose type annotation required), which proves
   http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/215482/what-are-the-safety-benefits-of-a-type-system[invaluable]
   in managing large projects.

.  Dead code: A large amount of web-development relies on inclusion of
   code dependencies by copying or referencing CDNs (the very thing
   that makes JavaScript highly accessible), but this also introduces
   a lot of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_code[dead code]. This
   impacts performance adversely when the JavaScript VM has to
   interpret code that will never be invoked. BuckleScript provides
   powerful dead-code elimination at all levels:

      - Function and module level elimination is facilitated by the
      sophistication of the type-system of OCaml and
      purity analysis.
      - At the global level BuckleScript generates code ready for
      dead-code elimination done by bundling tools such as the
      {closure}[Google closure-compiler].

.  Lack of offline optimizations: JavaScript is a dynamic language, it
   takes a performance-hit for the VM to optimize code at runtime.
   While some JS engines circumvent the problem to some extent by
   http://v8project.blogspot.com/2015/07/code-caching.html[caching],
   this is not available to all environments, and lack of a strong
   type system also limits the level of optimizations possible. Again,
   BuckleScript, using features of the OCaml type-system and compiler
   implementation is able to provide many optimizations during offline
   compilation, allowing the runtime code to be extremely fast.

. Run your programs on all platforms, but run your system *faster*
  under specific platforms. Javascript is everywhere but it does not
  mean we have to run all apps in JS, under several platforms, for
  example, server side or iOS/Android native apps, when programs are
  written in OCaml, it can also be compiled to native code for *best
  performance*.

While a strong type-system helps in countering these problems, at the
same time we hope to avoid some of the problems faced in using other
offline {transpile-list}[transpilation systems]:

* Slow compilation: OCaml byte-code compilation is known to be fast
  (one or two orders of magnitude faster than other similar languages:
http://www.scala-lang.org/[Scala] or
  https://www.haskell.org/[Haskell]),
  BuckleScript shares the same property and compiles even faster
  since it saves the link time. See the speeds at work in the
  {BuckleScript-playground}[playground], the native backend is one
  order faster than the JS backend.

* Un-readable JS Code and hard to integrate with existing JS
  libraries: When compiling to JavaScript, many systems
  generate code, that while syntactically and semantically correct is
  not human-readable and very difficult to debug and profile.
  Our BuckleScript implementation and the multi-pass compilation  strategy of OCaml,
  allows us to avoid {name-mangling}[name-mangling],
  and produce JavaScript code that is human-readable and easier to debug and
  maintain. More importantly, this makes integration with existing JS
  libraries much easier.

* Loss of code-structure: Many systems generate JavaScript code that is essentially a
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_ball_of_mud[big ball of mud]. We try
  to keep the original structure of the code by mapping one OCaml module
  to one JS module.


## Get Started

### Installation

#### Install from NPM releases

The standard npm package management tool can be used to install
BuckleScript. If you don't already have npm installed, follow the
directions listed
https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node[here]. Once npm
is installed, run the following command:

[source,sh]
------------------------------
npm install --save bs-platform
------------------------------

#### Install from source with `npm` package manager

.Prerequisites:

  . Standard C toolchain
  . `npm` (should be installed with Node)

.Instructions:
[source,sh]
-----
git clone https://github.com/bloomberg/bucklescript
cd bucklescript
npm install
-----

#### Install with minimal dependencies

.Prerequisites:

  . Standard C toolchain


BuckleScript has very few dependencies and building from source can
easily be done.


.Build OCaml compiler


[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------------
git clone --recursive https://github.com/bloomberg/bucklescript
cd ocaml
./configure -prefix `pwd` # put your preferred directory
make world.opt
make install
--------------------------------------------------------

The patched compiler is installed locally into your `$(pwd)/bin`
directory. To start using it temporarily, check if `ocamlc.opt` and
`ocamlopt.opt` exist in `$(pwd)/bin`, and temporarily add the location
to your `$(PATH)` (e.g.  `PATH=$(pwd)/bin:$PATH`).

.Building BuckleScript


The following directions assume you already have the correct version of
`ocamlopt.opt` in your `$PATH`, having followed the process described in
the previous section.

[source,sh]
-----------
export BS_RELEASE_BUILD=1
make world
-----------

'''''

At the end, you should have a binary called `bsc` under `jscomp/bin`
directory, which you can add to your `$PATH`.
You could also set an environment variable
pointing to the stdlib, e.g. `BSC_LIB=/path/to/jscomp/stdlib` for ease
of use.


### OCaml ecosystem: OPAM

When working with OCaml we also recommend using https://opam.ocaml.org[opam]
package manager to install OCaml tools, available
https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html[here]. You will benefit from the
existing OCaml ecosystem.

Once you have `opam` installed, ask `opam` to switch to using our
version of the compiler:

[source,sh]
---------------------------
opam update
opam switch 4.02.3
eval `opam config env`
---------------------------
